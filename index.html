    <p>      
The Braun Group has three lines of business:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Executive Biographies</li>
      <li>General Biographies</li>
      <li>Visual Biographies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
We work with you on each step of the writing and production process. We specialize in great service (customized for each client), rich content (deeply understanding executive life and decisions), and modern production (creating a combination of classic and new media companion products that audiences love). These formats include print books, audio books, e-books, podcasts, study guides, chapter summaries, author/subject speaking engagements, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
Our team consists of former executives, seasoned entrepreneurs, best-selling author, journalists, executive speechwriters, and award-winning graphics professionals and producers. We take pains to create and structure engaging stories—our best skills are developing stories that are fast-paced and character-driven as well as insightful. We have found that audiences love books that offer deep and specific insights about why someone made the choices during her or his life.
    </p>
    
    <h2>General Biographies</h2>

    <p>
Storytelling is a classic form of expression—from stories carved on cave walls and those told around a fire to plays, scripts, and novels. Although audience tastes vary widely and change frequently in terms of story format, the profound resonance of the story itself endures.
    </p>
    <p>
The Braun Group creates biographies and memoirs for people interested in telling their own or someone else’s story. We use numerous formats in our craft. The classic hard-copy book is our core format. Companion formats include e-book, audiobook, podcast, audio, and video links, and more. Books are typically 75-300 pages. As for content, some clients enjoy telling their story with a traditional narrative arc; others prefer ample original illustrations; and others love a coffee table book with gorgeous photos throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
The Braun Group writes your biography, ghostwrites your memoir, conducts research and fact checking, and edits, prints, and produces the book and companion products. Many clients prefer limited print editions so they can distribute the books to friends, family, and colleagues only. Some clients enjoy taking the commercial publishing route. The Braun Group can set up and manage their Amazon (or other) seller accounts. The uniting feature of everything we do with our General Biographies line of business is:

    <ul>
      <li>The biographies/memoirs are character-driven, action-packed, multi-format, go deep fast and</li>
      <li>They deliver insight, which we think, in addition to entertainment, is an important measure of success for any story.</li>
    </ul>

[Book image of Life With Ham:]

    <p>
Life With Ham by Terry Biggar: Friends and family pay tribute to Ham Biggar by recalling his many adventures playing squash, hunting, and building restaurants and night clubs in and around Cleveland. Each vignette beats with love for the man and his passion for life.
    </p>
    
[Book image of Three Families by Allen Ford:]

    <p>
Three Families by Allen Ford: This book traces the history and lives of three of the author’s ancestral families, showing us how men and women migrated to the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio in the early 19th century and brought with them their values of independence, freedom, and commitment to education.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Executive Biographies</h2>
Braun Group has worked with many executives to tell their stories, and now we’re launching a subscription to our Executive Biographies and Memoirs. Subscribers receive a link to one impeccably designed executive memoir and one executive biography. These are fast-paced, character-driven, multi-	format books by or about executives. Each book is 125 pages long and goes deep fast to uncover the professional and personal lives of each executive and goes beyond dry set-ups of situations and decisions to delve into deep crevices (and sometimes crevasses) of personality, background, and why they did what they did.

Subscribers, which includes business professionals, students, professors, and others, also have access to companion products, such as print-on-demand hard copies of the books, chapter summaries, study guides, podcasts, presentations, and live speaking engagements (in-person or via Skype). The Braun Group selects executives across industries, geographies, personality types, and issues faced so that the breadth and depth of experiences, mistakes, successes, and decisions collectively offer insight into global executive decision making.

(Executives who are interested in having The Braun Group ghostwrite their memoir or write their biography should contact us.) [Can have this as a side box or different font or color or something?]

    <h2>Visual Biographies</h2>

They say a picture paints a thousand words, and our Visual Biographies are a short, picture-based way to tell personal stories. They go deep fast and deliver insights at a glance for today’s audiences—family and friends of an individual, business professionals, students, professors, and others. The images used in Visual Biographies range from digital graphics to pencil drawings and richly colored cartoons—sometimes all three are combined in one Visual Biography. We create Visual Biographies in three formats:

Digital Flipbook. These are handsomely designed electronic flipbooks that are 5-15 pages long and can be posted on websites, distributed through social media (Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook), and viewed again and again by people at their computers and mobile devices.
Artistic Print. These put each frame from the electronic flipbook onto a large single page. This page is printed on high quality paper and framed in a high-end frame.
Attractive Booklet. These 5-15 page small booklets are printed and presented nicely (e.g., rolled up and tied with a ribbon). They make a great tabletop decoration or take-away for any event—award ceremony, birthday party, retirement, etc.
The key to making a great Visual Biography is the willingness to start with tons of information and go straight to the core of the traits, actions, and decisions—for better or worse—that comprise a person’s life. Sainthood isn’t interesting. People don’t relate to perfection, they relate to real people, and this is what Visual Biographies try to do in one glance.
