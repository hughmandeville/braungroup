      <div class="title">Executive Memoir:  Little Did We Know</div>
      <div class="byline">by John Miller</div>
      <div class="summary">
        “This is a very readable look into the workings of corporate finance. The author managed to explain technical subject matter with a simple, clear style and a touch of humor. I read the book with a bit of nostalgia for an America that was not afraid to do great things in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.”
