      Storytelling is a classic form of expression — from stories carved on cave walls and those told around a fire to plays, scripts, and novels. The classic hard-copy book is The Braun Group's core format. Companion formats include e-book, audiobook, podcast, audio, and video links, and more. Books are typically 75-300 pages.

      <br/><br/>

      The Braun Group writes your biography, ghostwrites your memoir, conducts research and fact checking, and edits, prints, and produces the book and companion products. Many clients prefer limited print editions so they can distribute the books to friends, family, and colleagues only. Some clients enjoy taking the commercial publishing route. The Braun Group can set up and manage their Amazon (or other) seller accounts.
