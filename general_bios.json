 "quote": "This is a great story about American enterprise at the cutting edge. Too often we do not get such a clear and personal view of the challenges associated with major innovations. Mr. Miller was fortunate to be in an industry at a dynamic period of opportunity, and we are fortunate that he has shared his story with us.",
 "quote2": "This is a very readable look into the workings of corporate finance. The author managed to explain technical subject matter with a simple, clear style and a touch of humor. I read the book with a bit of nostalgia for an America that was not afraid to do great things in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.",
 "text": "The remarkable story about building and financing the Trans Alaska Pipeline as told by John Miller, the finance professional who raises more than $6 billion to pay for the Standard Oil Company of Ohioâ€™s portion of the Alaskan venture."
