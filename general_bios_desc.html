Love of Cleveland is a life theme for Gries and his ancestors.

      <h2><span class="book_title">Gumption and Gusto</span> by Neil Ruddock</h2><br>
When Betty Kidder Ruddock was three, her mother died of diphtheria. Then her father lost his job, succumbed to alcoholism, and was unable to support his family. By age eight, Betty was living with strangers in a boarding house near Akron, Ohio, begging for food and making money by picking strawberries. Betty’s husband tells her story of human resilience, forgiveness, and joy.
