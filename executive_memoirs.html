    <h1>Executive Memoirs</h1>
    
    <div class="col1a">
      The Braun Group has worked with many executives to tell their stories. These are fast-paced, character-driven, multi- format books by or about executives. Each book is 125 pages long and goes deep fast. Readers learn about and understand the decisions of an executive, and they can delve deeply into an executive’s personality, background, and the “why”s of her or his decisions.

      <br/><br/>

      The Braun Group selects executives across industries, geographies, personality types, and issues faced so that the breadth and depth of experiences, mistakes, successes, and decisions collectively offer insight into global executive decision making.

      <br/><br/>
