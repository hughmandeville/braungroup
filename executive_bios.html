    <h2>Executive Biographies</h2>
    <p>
Braun Group has worked with many executives to tell their stories, and now weâ€™re launching a subscription to our Executive Biographies and Memoirs. Subscribers receive a link to one impeccably designed executive memoir and one executive biography. These are fast-paced, character-driven, multi-	format books by or about executives. Each book is 125 pages long and goes deep fast to uncover the professional and personal lives of each executive and goes beyond dry set-ups of situations and decisions to delve into deep crevices (and sometimes crevasses) of personality, background, and why they did what they did.
    </p>
    <p>
Subscribers, which includes business professionals, students, professors, and others, also have access to companion products, such as print-on-demand hard copies of the books, chapter summaries, study guides, podcasts, presentations, and live speaking engagements (in-person or via Skype). The Braun Group selects executives across industries, geographies, personality types, and issues faced so that the breadth and depth of experiences, mistakes, successes, and decisions collectively offer insight into global executive decision making.

(Executives who are interested in having The Braun Group ghostwrite their memoir or write their biography should contact us.) [Can have this as a side box or different font or color or something?]
