    <h2>General Biographies</h2>

    <p>
Storytelling is a classic form of expression—from stories carved on cave walls and those told around a fire to plays, scripts, and novels. Although audience tastes vary widely and change frequently in terms of story format, the profound resonance of the story itself endures.
    </p>
    <p>
The Braun Group creates biographies and memoirs for people interested in telling their own or someone else’s story. We use numerous formats in our craft. The classic hard-copy book is our core format. Companion formats include e-book, audiobook, podcast, audio, and video links, and more. Books are typically 75-300 pages. As for content, some clients enjoy telling their story with a traditional narrative arc; others prefer ample original illustrations; and others love a coffee table book with gorgeous photos throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
The Braun Group writes your biography, ghostwrites your memoir, conducts research and fact checking, and edits, prints, and produces the book and companion products. Many clients prefer limited print editions so they can distribute the books to friends, family, and colleagues only. Some clients enjoy taking the commercial publishing route. The Braun Group can set up and manage their Amazon (or other) seller accounts. The uniting feature of everything we do with our General Biographies line of business is:

    <ul>
      <li>The biographies/memoirs are character-driven, action-packed, multi-format, go deep fast and</li>
      <li>They deliver insight, which we think, in addition to entertainment, is an important measure of success for any story.</li>
    </ul>
