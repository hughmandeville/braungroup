The Braun Group creates biographies and memoirs for people interested in telling their own or someone else’s story.

      <p>
Storytelling is a classic form of expression — from stories carved on cave walls and those told around a fire to plays, scripts, and novels. The classic hard-copy book is The Braun Group's core format. Companion formats include e-book, audiobook, podcast, audio, and video links, and more. Books are typically 75-300 pages.
      </p>
      <p>
The Braun Group writes your biography, ghostwrites your memoir, conducts research and fact checking, and edits, prints, and produces the book and companion products. Many clients prefer limited print editions so they can distribute the books to friends, family, and colleagues only. Some clients enjoy taking the commercial publishing route. The Braun Group can set up and manage their Amazon (or other) seller accounts.

        The uniting feature of everything we do with our General Biographies line of business is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The biographies/memoirs are character-driven, action-packed, multi-format, go deep fast and</li>
        <li>They deliver insight, which we think, in addition to entertainment, is an important measure of success for any story.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><span class="book_title">Five Generations</span> by Bob Gries</h2><br>
Philanthropist and investor Bob Gries tells the remarkable stories of five generations of his family, from Simson Thorman, who arrived in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1830s and became the city’s first Jewish settler, to the founders of May Company and the Cleveland Browns football team. Love of Cleveland is a life theme for Gries and his ancestors.

      <h2><span class="book_title">Gumption and Gusto</span> by Neil Ruddock</h2><br>
When Betty Kidder Ruddock was three, her mother died of diphtheria. Then her father lost his job, succumbed to alcoholism, and was unable to support his family. By age eight, Betty was living with strangers in a boarding house near Akron, Ohio, begging for food and making money by picking strawberries. Betty’s husband tells her story of human resilience, forgiveness, and joy.
